# pyBDP

Python PRISM reduction pipeline

# Dependencies and Setup

pyBDP requires installation of the "AstroImage" class. This can be downloaded
from the jmontgom10 GitHub repository and has its own set of dependencies, which
the user should take care to install properly (see the AstroImage README File a
guide on install those packages).

I recommend using the Anaconda environment, as that comes with numpy, scipy,
astropy, and matplotlib preinstalled. If you elect not to use Anaconda, then
make sure to get those packages properly installed before proceeding to install
the AstroImage dependencies.
